# 📊 Statistical Learning Project

A clean, student-friendly template for your course project README.

**Goal:** Apply statistical learning to real-world data with a clear, reproducible workflow. Focus on what you *did* and *why*, not on textbook definitions.

---

## 🧭 Purpose
This project gives you hands-on experience with data cleaning, exploration, modeling, and interpretation across multiple learning paradigms.

---

## ✅ Tasks (Choose at least two)

### 1) Regression — Predict Final Grade
Use at least two methods chosen from: **Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Neural Networks**.

- **Dataset:** [Download link 1](#) · [Dataset description](#)  
- **Deliverables:** preprocessing steps, EDA visuals, model setup, hyperparameters, metrics (e.g., MAE/RMSE/R²), interpretation of important features.

---

### 2) Classification — Predict Obesity Levels
Use at least two methods chosen from: **Logistic Regression, KNN, LDA, SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks**.

- **Dataset:** [Download link 2](#) · [Dataset description](#)  
- **Deliverables:** preprocessing/encoding, class balance handling, EDA, model setup, hyperparameters, metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix), interpretation.
