PURPOSE
This project aims to provide hands-on experience applying statistical learning methods to real-world scenarios. The project will also provide practical insights into data cleaning, exploration, modeling, and interpretation.

TASK

You must work individually and complete at least two tasks: regression, classification, and clustering. Apply statistical learning methods to analyze the dataset, preprocess it, build at least two models, assess their performance, and interpret the outcomes.

Task 1 - Regression: predict the final grade using at least two methods: Linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
